# Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make
the open source community such a great community! 😊

The tips and guidelines below are intended to help both contributors and maintainers respect each other's time and effect change as quickly as possible.

- **Bugs and Feature Requests**: Follow the templates [here](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun/issues/new/choose) to report problems or ideas. Don't be surprised if you're asked for clarification or opinions on solutions.
- **Code**: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code,
  commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It
  helps us triage them.
- **Documentation**: Update or add a page to the [wiki](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun/wiki) or improve some already existing documentation to help other users.
- **Something Else?**: This list isn't conclusive so if you have another idea for contribution, please reach out.

# Ground Rules

**Responsibilities**
- Be welcoming and treat everyone with respect as per the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Before doing any major work, [open an issue](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun/issues/new/choose) to garner community feedback.


# Your First Code Contribution

Working on your first pull request? You can learn how from this _free_ series,
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

[Here are some good first issues.](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

If you get stuck push your code early and ask for feedback on the issue.

# Getting started

1. After you check out the code, run `npm install` to get the rikaikun dev tools ready.
2. Make your changes and commit them locally. Run `npm run fix` often to ensure your code follows style guidelines.
3. Run `npm run build` to create an unpackaged instance of rikaikun in the `dist` directory. Load this into Chrome to test your changes.
4. When you're satisifed, commit you're code (make sure to follow the commit message guidelines) and start a pull request.

# Pull Requests

Pull requests are where the main discussion around *how* you implemented your change will happen. The following guidelines will ensure a quick and painless merge.

- Each PR should solve one concern and be of reasonable size.

### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

[source: [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express#philosophy)] **Need more inspiration?** [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin#goals)

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

# BONUS: Code, commit message and labeling conventions
These sections are not necessary, but can help streamline the contributions you receive.

### Explain your preferred style for code, if you have any.
